# Software Testing
 This repository contains all the assignments done in the course software testing at BTH.

# Assignment GUI TESTING:
For this assignment, we will focus on regression testing and the development of test cases that follow best practices for writing automated tests. For the assignment, we picked any SUT you want (web, mobile, or desktop) which has a graphical user interface that you can automate using either EyeAutomate, Selenium or other GUI testing tool of your choice.
The "Automated GUI Based Testing" project focuses on developing and implementing a series of automated graphical user interface tests for a job search website, Glassdoor, based on specific user stories and acceptance criteria. The aim is to ensure that key functionalities on the website work as expected, enhancing user experience by allowing for personalization and efficient navigation.

# Software Testing Project:
Project description:

In teams of four (4) students, we have set up a continuous integration (CI) environment that can build the software project and execute tests automatically. The environment shall respond to developer code pushes and from push, build the entire system and run, at least, unit and integration test cases but preferably system tests. The environment include:

An integrated development environment ( intellij IDEA)
A version control server ( Github)
A continuous integration (CI) tool (e.g. Jenkins)
An automated build tool that connects to the CI tool (e.g. Maven )
An automated test framework for AT LEAST unit and integration tests (e.g. JUnit)
